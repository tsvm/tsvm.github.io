I am a postdoctoral researcher in Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. I work on adapting large language models for personalized learning and human-robot interaction.

I obtained my PhD in 2022 from Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon, Portugal under the supervision of [André Martins](https://andre-martins.github.io/) and [Vlad Niculae](https://vene.ro/), where I researched modeling the structure of language with deep neural networks.
During my master studies, I worked on fact-checking and question answering, supervised by [Preslav Nakov](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/preslav-nakov/). 
Before joining academia, I worked in industry as a software developer.
